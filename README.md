# Alu

Alu is a beautiful, functional, and sleek web proxy, which focuses on customization and ease of use.

# Features

- UV and Rammerhead support
- Themes
- Multiple site cloaking options
- 50+ Games to choose from
- English and Japanese support
- High performance

# Deploying Alu
Deploying Alu is about as simple as it gets, from your terminal, type 

`git clone https://github.com/wearrrrr/Alu --recursive-submodules`

This command should clone Alu's frontend, as well as [alu-games](https://github.com/wearrrrr/alu-games). If you wish to skip cloning games, then leave out the last flag.

Then simply run `npm i` to install all node_modules, and then build the frontend with `npm run build`, this shouldn't take more than a couple seconds.

Finally, run `npm start` to actually serve Alu! It defaults to port 3000 for everything, but this can be specified in an env file.

Congrats, you've now deployed your very own web proxy!
